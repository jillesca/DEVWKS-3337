# DEVWKS-3337 - Building AI Agents for Network Operations with LangGraph

## Lab Overview

This repository contains resources and configurations for the Cisco Live workshop `DEVWKS-3337`.

> [!NOTE]  
> The VMs used are provided during the workshop. If you find this repository and want to try the instructions, you need to use your own VMs and update the IP from these instructions.

The workshop uses two virtual machines with the following roles:

- `198.18.134.28`
  - Host for XRd containers
- Workshop Laptop
  - Host for agents and tooling.

Working directory:

```bash
/home/devnet/DEVWKS-3337

```

### Repositories used

- **[xrd-lab](https://github.com/jillesca/XRd-Labs)** Contains all files to deploy Cisco XRd containers (docker-compose files, configs).

- **[gnmi-buddy](https://github.com/jillesca/gNMIBuddy)** gNMI Tool used by the Langgraph agents to connect to the network devices.

- **[sp_oncall](https://github.com/jillesca/sp_oncall)** The Graph of agents.

- **[DEVWKS-3337](https://github.com/jillesca/DEVWKS-3337)** This repo (the one you are reading now). Which contains step-by-step instructions, ansible playbooks and inventory
